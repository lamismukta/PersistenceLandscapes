# PersistenceLandscapes

This repository contains all the scripts for my persistence landscapes package.

There are functions for generating barcodes and creating persistence landscapes, including averages and distances on them too. 

Additionally, I have some example protein data and examples of using the functions in the examples folder. 

There are also a few protein-specific experiments.

This is some of the supporting code for my published research paper 'Homology of Homologous Knotted Proteins': https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2022.0727
